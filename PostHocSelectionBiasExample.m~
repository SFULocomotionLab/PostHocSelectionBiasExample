% A typical experimental design involves applying a range of treatments to
% different participants and testing if these treatments have an effect.
% This is a good experimental design if one tests whether treatment A has
% an effect compared to the null condition, for example. But one thing that is not
% OK is to select the treatment that has the largest effect for each
% participant (treatment B for participant 1, treatment C for participant
% 2, etc.), averaging these effects across participants, and then
% concluding that customized treatments have a net effect. Because of the
% random variability in measurements, where some measurements are higher
% and some are lower by chance and not by treatment, it is very likely to
% find an effect where none is present.

% After Barazesh & Sharbafi, let's use 8 subjects and 7 different treatment
% conditions.
subjectsN = 8;
trialsN = 7;

% We also need to know the measurement variability. That is, were we to
% repeatedly sample from the same individual under the same condition, what
% would be the variability in the result? We don't typically know this
% value in most reported experiments because we only measure each
% individual at each condition once. We can't use the between subject
% variability as it includes both the measurement variability and the
% differences between subjects. Here I use a standard deviation of 5%,
% which is roughly what we find when we have done the correct experiments
% to identify this measurement variability in our lab. Note that I can't
% tell from Barazesh & Sharbafi paper how long they average over (2 min? 3
% min?), or how good their e
